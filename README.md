# Orc Slayer
Welcome to my first, personal, pygame project! This game is a very barebones representation of a roguelite such as Vampire Survivors or Halls of Torment. You will walk around the screen, dispatching enemies of varying difficulty as they spawn. While leveling, you will gain abilities that help you defeat tougher foes as the round progresses. Working through this project provided me the benefit of learning how to implement a variety of game features:
- Animations and working with sprite sheets.
- Basic NPC pathing.
- Rendering images and other graphics to the screen.
- Hitboxes and collision.
- Managing object attributes.
- Creating a basic User Interface.

Hopefully my effort keeps you entertained for at least the duration of the 10 minute round!
